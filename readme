MotionMap 3



This project is an indigo plugin that establishes associations between motion sensors and other devices in your home.
It supports insteon devices (switches, outlets and thermostats, Relays, etc).
Insteon motions sensors and some ZWave multisensors are supported as well. The plugin, when installed and activated within instean, will parse a CSV file located
in _Configurations folder to establish relationships between devices - there are more descriptions in the _Configuration files.
Also check our MotionMapPlugion.py for more details. That file defines (among other things) what configuration file should be parsed on startup.
There are some theory of operation files in _Documentaion, but alas nothing is complete - this is not a commercial product, just something I put together to control my own homes.
It does in fact work and has been working for my purposes for several years in several homes.


Indigo is owned by Perceptive Automation. Some of the files here are based on their sample files.

A few things you can do with this plugin...

Associate Master (load) light switches with companion (noload) switches. Usage would include a load switch at the end of a hall and a
companion at the other end. Instead of linking both switches through Insteon protocol, link one-way companion to master so the master
has high response rate. The problem this solves is that you are not linking two way (which causes communication collisions in busy insteon
deployments). THe MotionMap plugin will take care of making the companion switch match the Master's settings (i.e. the indicator LEDs will
match on both ends of the hall - a pet peeve of mine

Associate master (load) switch with motion activity. Upon entering a room, the light will come on (and you will ge the benefit above if you
have companion switches). Also, you can specify (in the configuration file) a separate daytime and nighttime brightness setting for the
switch (which means you can enjoy automatic nughtlight illumination upon entering a dark room instead of full-on brightness that you might
want in daytime).

Automatic light off in the absense of motion (or after a specified duration of on-time)

Comprehensive house occupation events. Lock doors, turn off fireplaces activate heater setbacks when nobody is home, of reverse that when you arrive.

Ultra smart thermostats based on occupation. Weighted average temperatures in rooms (assuming you are using multisensors like I am) control the
temp settings based on whole-house room-occupation knowledge.

Much more reliable system. MotionMap controls all devices in your house while minimizing uncrolled traffic in the insteon/zwave networks. You can delay
commands to devices till after the network settles, plus all commands that MotionMap sends can be queued (i.e. a new command wont be dispatched until
the preceeding cmoand is complete). Motionmap is aware of command failures and does retries as needed for mission critical commands.

One-shot or recurring actions. For example MotionMap is programmed to status request sequentially to all the devices in the house to insure they
are in their expected states (only when the network is idle)

Device failure and low battery notifications. If you have an insteon/zwave device that fails to respond after a certain number of retries, you will get
a text message or email alerting you of a problem. Same with low battery warnings.

API published to indigo.  You can make Indigo action groups that command MotionMap to take advantage of any feature listed above.
