# MotionMap.config
#
#   Version             Comment
#       2.0             Added MultiSensor, Thermostat, Scene and Occupation Actions
#       1.0             Support for Motion Sensor, Companion and Load devices
#
# This file defines the behaviors of all the devices in a MotionMap home automation environment.
# MotionMap operates as a plug-in to a Perceptive Indigo server and is dependant on the Insteon protocols and devices.
# Devices described here consist of Dimmers SwitchesOutletsThermostatsand Motion Sensors
#
# === WARNING DO NOT USE COMMAS IN THIS CSV FILE - EVEN IN THE COMMENTS ===
#
# Indigo Classifications of devices
#
#   Controllers – A device that controls another device. Dimmers and motions sensors are good examples of these
#   Responders – A device that is controlled by another device
#
#
# MotionMap device families and their behavioral traits
#
#  MotionSensor – A motion Sensor that will effect a loadDevice
#  MultiSensor – Same as above, but with additional functionality such as Luminance, temperature, and vibration sensor functions
#  LoadDevices – A Switch or Dimmer usually a loadDevice that can potentially command other devices
#  Companions – A switch or Dimmer that is usually not a loadDevice device but endeavors to mimic the state of a loadDevice device (the non-loadDevice switch in a 3 way hallway switch environment)
#  HVAC_Insteon, HVAC_Nest - Thermostats. MotionMap will use input from these devices along with knowledge of motion and temperature sensors (multisensor) to adjust the climate in the house
#  HVAC_Insteon_Companion - A thermostat that is just used for acquiring human input and temperature sensing (no HVAC control on this unit - it will send messages to an assigned thermostat defined above)
#  OccupationAction - An occupation trigger that can be programatically defined. When triggered an indigo action will be launched
#  Scene - A collection of Load devices that will be turned on or off together. Scenes are a redefinition of the groups defined within indigo that make for a more reliable group control
#
#
# Syntax of this file
#
#  This file is parsed by MotionMap.py. It must be saved in CSV format to operate
#
#  Blank lines are skipped and ignored
#  Processing will continue till the end of the file unless stopped by the “-.” directive below
#  Lines that begin with '#' are comment lines and are not parsed
#  Lines that begin with '-' are directive lines that control the parsing flow as follows:
#
#    -d (or -debug) Turn on normal parsing debugging. This will echo minimal information to the indigo log during parsing for progress monitoring
#    -e (or -echo) Echo the following cell to the console during parsing
#    -h (or -header) The following line is a header for device type in cell B
#    -v (or -verbose) Turn on verbose debugging. This will echo detailed progress information to the indigo log during parsing
#    -p (or -pause) Pause Processing (used while debugging the parser and/or this config file)
#    -r (or -resume) Resume Processing  (used while debugging the parser and/or this config file)
#    -s (or -set) Set an environment variable or preference in MotionMap
#    -. Stop Processing  (used while debugging the parser and/or this config file)

#
#   IMPORTANT – Keep Motion sensors above all other devices because the other devices will register with the motion sensors during initialization (one pass)

# HVAC_Insteon_Companion – Thermostat
#
# The Insteon wireless thermostat is typically used for this device, it is battery powered and goes to sleep. This means
#	that we cannot send commands to this thermostat nor can we send update requests. Instead, what we do is watch for commands from this device and
#	use that information to influence the settings of the associated master thwermostat (which actually controls the furnace and air conditioner).
#	We do, however get information that is broadcast from this thermostat when something in it changes, we note this information and can provide it to
#	other devices when we are asked for it.
#
#   deviceName – The English name of the device
