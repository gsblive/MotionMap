For those of you trying to remove a node using zensys tool here are the steps required:
1. Highlight the node you believe has failed from the top left frame's node list/table
2. Toggle the "Quene Overrided" checkbox for this selected node (a check should appear)
3. Send a NOP (i.e. no operation) command by selecting the exclamation mark from the tools menu
4. Check to see if the node is failed by selecting the "is node failed" icon from the tools menu. If it has failed, you should see a message stating it has failed in the lower right frame (i.e. log actions tab)
5. Select the "remove failed" icon from the tools menu
Note: If uncertain which icon from the tools menu corresponds to a particular action, hoover your mouse over each to receive a "tool tip" message specifying the corresponding action.
